The following steps are used to build and install the application in /cs/certified

Note that although the compilation in step #3 must use Java 17 (available on RHEL9, but not on 7), the
resulting jar file from the compilation produces compatible bytecode will run on the older
java runtime on our RHEL7  systems.

1.  On an RHEL9 dev workstation, change to a clean working directory and check
out the the source code from github.

git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/logentrycli.git
cd logentrycli

2. (Optional) Switch to a specific tagged version

# Use git tag to list available versions
git tag
# Checkout the one that is desired
git checkout 2.0

3. Compile/Build using gradle

# The special SSL certificates are need to operate through JLab intercepting proxy

gradlew -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/java/cacerts clean
gradlew -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/java/cacerts make

4. Recursively copy the contents of the bin and lib subdirectories to a suitable install location.

cp -r bin/* lib/* /cs/certified/apps/logentrycli/2.0/
chmod 555 /cs/certified/apps/logentrycli/2.0/bin/logentry

5.  Rotate the PRO link

cd /cs/certifieds/apps/logentrycli
rm PRO; ln -s 2.0 PRO

6. If necessary, create a symbolic link to the PRO wrapper script
from /usr/csite/certified/bin to the PRO version

cd  /usr/csite/certified/bin
ln -s  /cs/certified/apps/logentrycli/PRO/bin/logentry .
