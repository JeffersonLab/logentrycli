The following steps are used to build and install the application:

1.  Change to a clean working directory and check out the the source code.

git clone ssh://devl00/usr/devsite/git/logentrycli.git 
cd logentrycli

2. (Optional) Switch to a specific tagged version


# Use git tag to list available versions
git tag
# Checkout the one that is desired
git checkout 1.0


3. Compile/Build using ant

ant dist 

4. Recursively copy the contents of the dist subdirectory to a suitable install location.  

cp -r dist/* /cs/certified/apps/logentrycli/1.0

5. Edit the contents of bin/logentry and edit the JAR variable to point to the
location where you installed the jar file in step 4 (or perhaps even better use a pro link).

vi bin/logentry
JAR=/cs/certified/apps/logentrycli/pro/logentrycli.jar

6. Copy the executable wrapper script to a directory from which users can find
and excute it.

cp bin/logentry /cs/certified/bin/logentry
chmod 555 /cs/certified/bin/logentry

7. (Optional) If the jlog2.jar file can be found on the classpath listed in
manifest.mf, the copy in the dist/lib directory can be removed.

rm /cs/certified/apps/logentrycli/1.0/lib/jlog2.jar
